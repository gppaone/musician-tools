## Svelte Musician Tools

### Random Note/Chord
This component gives you a random note/chord/scale from the 12 possible major keys for you to practice.

### Metronome
This is a simple metronone where you can customize the BPM speed for your practice needs.

### Possible enhancements
- Give Random Chord a timer so notes change after a set amount of time automatically
- Add a selection of sounds to the Metronome such as woodblock, bell.
- Add ability for there to be a different sound on the 4 of the beat.  *dink dink dink DING*
